## Introduction

Point Cloud Quality Assessment (PCQA) is an essential task in computer vision, especially for applications involving 3D data, such as virtual reality, autonomous driving, and 3D reconstruction. The goal of this repository is to provide resources and tools to help you learn about PCQA, from basic concepts to advanced algorithms.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

## Learning-materials
Here, we mainly conduct experiments using three PCQA methods: FR, RR, and NR.

## EXPERIMENT
All experiments were implemented on a server with INTEL I9-14900K CPU, 64 GB RAM and NVIDIA RTX4090D-24G GPU.
